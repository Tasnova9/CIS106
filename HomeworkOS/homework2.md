1.	What are the advantages of open source?

The advantages of open source are that it is available for all users to inspect, modify, copy, and use anywhere the user desires to. The free copied software can be transformed into a collaborative project. 
  
2.	What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?

The basic freedoms that make a software open source is no restriction while utilizing someone else's codes. Additional Licensing which  prohibits people from grasping the codes is not a part of the open-source software. The original programming is made available alongside the main program where users can customize and maintain the original data. 
  
3.	Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?

People should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version because the use, distribution, and modification of open-source software are completely free. It has lower expenses, which are usually a fraction of the cost compared to proprietary software. The open-source software allows collaboration inside an environment which evolves by contributors. It also imprints the idea of using the software in whatever way a user wants because user has every right to do so. The programs can be easily copied or distributed over internet. The proprietary software or user subjugating software is an instrument of unjust power for one entity over other, thus people should consider the alternative open-source software rather than the proprietary version.
  
4.	Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.

I agree with Richard Stallman because I strongly believe in order to control the program the user needs certain access which symbolizes freedom to control the program when Stallman emphasizes. If users are restricted and any part of the essential freedom is missing then the users can not effectively work on the program on the given circumstances.
